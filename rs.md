reed solomon
============

reed-solomon codes are a subset of __BCH codes__ and __linear block codes__

reed-solomon is specified as `RS( n, k )`

bch codes
---------

BCH codes ( Bose â€“ Chaudhuri - Hocquenghem ) codes form a large class of multiple random error-correcting codes

- bch codes are cyclic codes ( only codes, not decoding )

reed solomon codes
------------------

reed-solomon codes are a subset of __BCH codes__

characteristics are :

- error-correcting code based on univariate polynomials over finite fields

- able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors

- used to mostly correct the burst errors

- can correct up to `2 * e + v <= nsym`, where e is the number of errors, v the number of erasures and nsym = n-k = the number of ECC (error correction code) symbols
